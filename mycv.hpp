 *	@brief		OpenCV helper<br>
 *				This file defines macros for ease of use of OpenCV.<br>
 *				And include OpenCV library header as well as disable
 *				stupid warning.<br>
 *				You can use this file as follow.
 *
 				@code
 					#include "mycv.hpp"
 					#pragma comment(lib, OPENCV_LIB_EXPAND("core"))
 				@endcode
 *
 *				OPENCV_LIB_EXPAND macro replace the module name with corresponding
 *				library file name, e.g. opencv_core246.lib or opencv_246d.lib, by
 *				expanding library prefix, version string and debug or release postfix.
